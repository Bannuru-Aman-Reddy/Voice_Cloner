# Voice Cloning using SV2TTS
An implementation of Transefer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (Sv2TTS) with a vocoder.

SV2TTS is a comprehensive deep learning framework consisting of three distinct stages. In the initial stage, it generates a digital voice representation based on a short duration of audio data. Subsequently, in the second and third stages, this representation is used as a reference point to facilitate the generation of speech corresponding to any given text input.
